# VanLife project website

VanLife website, created by practicing React Router skills with a little bit use of React Query.

## Running instructions

Install the needed dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Once the setup is complete, run the project

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## In order to access the Host page, use next data for Login:
email: project@test.com
password: q123

One part of website data is hard-coded (Host Dashboard, Host Income and Host Reviews).
Again, this website is created by React Router practicing and that's the reason for mentioned sections use.

Do not refresh the page on the Netlify's live version because website is going to crash, that's the bug from the platform, code is working perfectly by running from VS code.
